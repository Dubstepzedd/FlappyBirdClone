## Description
My first project in C++. The project is a simple clone of the game Flappy Bird that uses the graphics library
[SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) which I have never previously used. The game has a main menu, death menu and of course
the actual game. If you hit the top/bottom of the window or any of the pipes - you "die" which means that you failed and
have to try again. Because Flappy Bird is infinite the only thing that measures how well it went is your score. 
The more points, the better of course. The project is made using OOP ([Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)).


## Usage of project
I do not <b>own</b> the images used in this project, and the <b>idea</b> of "Flappy Bird" is not mine. 
This software is solely for <b>educational purposes</b> and shall not be used in any other manner.

## Improvements to be made
I learned a lot while developing this simple clone, and I therefore think it is valid to discuss what can be improved on.

1. First off, I use ordinary pointers in this game. I do not use any "smart pointers" or equivalent. The reason
for this is quite simple. I developed this game in order to understand C++ more as we use it in university courses and 
they did not mention that there existed anything else than these ordinary pointers. This is something that can be 
improved on in future projects as it will make it easier to manage memory.

2. Documenting the code more is something that has to be made to the project. While writing this, the source code is not
well commented at all.

3. There are some visual bugs in the game, and the game lacks visual effects. This can be added to the game in order to
make it more unique and improve quality.
